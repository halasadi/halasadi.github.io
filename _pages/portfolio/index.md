## Modeling Human Dispersal and Population Density over Space (2018).

Here, we developed a model for inferring dispersal rates and population densities across space. Our model uses population genetic theory to relate the observed genetic data to the underlying demographic parameters. We apply our method to humans populations in Europe. Based on this work, I was selected as a *Semifinalist for the Charles J. Epstein Award for Excellence in Human Genetics Research*.

## Inference and visualization of ancient DNA damage (2018).

<figure class="aligncenter">

</figure>

Here, we very much motivated by our first hand experience in working with the data. We realized that many of the current approaches to assess ancient DNA quality failed to capture hidden structure in the data and did not provide concise visual summaries of the data. To attempt to remedy these problems, we developed an approach based on "grade of membership"" models (also known as "topic models").
