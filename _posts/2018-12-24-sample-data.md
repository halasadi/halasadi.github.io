One of my motivations in starting this blog is to write about the various technical issues (e.g. statistical problems) I face in Biotech. 

Most of the time is spent figuring out what the problem is,

But I do spend a significant amount of time thinking about the statistical nature of the data. Here is a screen shot of the whiteboard from a recent meeting.
